## 📱 Overview

**ValheimVikiApp** is a fully functional mobile application built in **Kotlin** and **Jetpack
Compose** using the **MVVM architecture pattern**.  
It serves as an extensive, user-friendly companion for the game **Valheim**, providing detailed
information on items, crafting, biomes, creatures, and more — all in a clean, modern UI.

While the app is complete and production-ready, it is **not yet published** on the Google Play
Store.  
A private backend exists for data retrieval, but it is **not publicly accessible**.
